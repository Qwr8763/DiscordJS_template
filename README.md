Description: For the sake of learning NODE JS, I decided to share my first bot work with you. It has a Mention, i.e. If it is marked you get a reply message, it also has a status, cooldown and token hiding through the DOTENV module. I decided to add an answer to the INCORRECT command, i.e. if we enter any command and it is not correct, the bot adds an emote to this command.
